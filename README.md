## Members of the team: Pau Ferro, Erik Pelusi, Fernanda Rivera
## Intro to Battleship: Battleship is a classic two-player guessing game where each player has a grid representing a sea area. Each player arranges their ships on their grid without the opponent seeing. Players take turns calling out coordinates to try to hit their opponent's ships. If a player's guess matches a location of their opponent's ship, it's a hit; otherwise, it's a miss. The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
